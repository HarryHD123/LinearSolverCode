
1.  Please enter the problem type by typing '1' for maximisation and '0' for minimisation after 'Problem Type:' below:
    NOTE: Set Dual to the opposite of the Problem Type (i.e. 1 and 0 or 0 and 1)

    Problem Type: 1
    Dual: 0

2.  Please enter the coefficients of the objective function between the stars:

    Example:

    for objective function:     enter:
    z = 60x1 + 90x2 + 300x3     60, 90, 300

    OBJECTIVE FUNCTION
    *
    60, 90, 300
    *


3.  Please enter the coefficients of the inequalities between the braces (curly brackets).
    If the coefficients are less than or equal to (<=), add a < at the end of the list,
    if greater than or equal to (>=), add a > at the end of the list:
    NOTE: Include coefficient even if coefficient is 0

    Format: variable coefficients, value coefficient, sign (1 or -1)

    Example:

    for constraints:        enter:
    x1 + x2 + x3 <= 600     1, 1, 1, <, 600
    x1 + 3x2 <= 600         1, 3, 0, <, 600
    2x1 + x3 >= 900         2, 0, 1, >, 900

    INEQUALITIES
    {
    1,1,1,<,600
    1,3,0,<,600
    2,0,1,<,900
    }


4.  Please enter the coefficients of the equalities between the braces using the same format as 3.
    NOTE: Include coefficient even if coefficient is 0
