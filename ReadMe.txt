AUTHOR: Harry Hamilton-Deeley

DESCRIPTION:
This program is designed to solve linear programing problems using the simplex method to solve maximisation problems
and the dual simplex method to solve minimisation problems.

Multiple optima can be detected and the general solution to a problem found for maximisation problems.

USAGE:.
The program is controlled by changing Input.txt, which gives example inputs and the format it requires.
